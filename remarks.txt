== Remarks while trying to fill in the 'Model math' in the fskx editor node ==

* Fitting procedure - this can be different per parameter. It would be more logical per parameter to have a 'source', which could be "literature", "fitted", "calculated", etc
* I don't understand "Event", and the explanation "Definition of time-dependent parameter changes"
* Where can I find the documentation?
* Related: the RAKIP website can use a restructure (have a look at mc-stan)
