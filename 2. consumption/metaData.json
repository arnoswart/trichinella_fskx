The model quantifies the distribution of Trichinella muscle larve (ML) in swine, test sensitivity at carcass control, partitioning of edible pork parts, Trichinella ML distribution in edible muscle types, heat inactivation by cooking and portion sizes. The resulting exposure estimate is combined with a dose response model for Trichinella species to estimate the incidence of human illness after consumption of infected meat. Parameter estimation is based on experimental and observational datasets."},"scope":{"product":[{"name":"Swine","unit":"Animal","originCountry":"Poland"},{"name":"Swine","description":"shoulder, bally or lion","unit":"Portion","originCountry":"Poland"}],"hazard":[{"type":"Not in list","name":"Trichinella spp., unspecified","description":"Trichinella muscle larve (ML)","unit":"add"}],"populationGroup":[{"name":"human consumer, no age specification","country":["Poland"]}],"generalComment":"A farm-to-fork model for the risk of human trichinellosis from pork and wild boar meat that is based on experimental and observational datasets.","temporalInformation":"2007-2012","spatialInformation":["Poland"]},"dataBackground":{"study":{"identifier":"FranssenEtAl2017","title":"Parasite to patient: A quantitative risk model for Trichinella spp. in pork and wild boar meat","description":"A farm-to-fork model for the risk of human trichinellosis from pork and wild boar meat that is based on experimental and observational datasets.
